<p>Hello, my name is Dongie Agnir, and I'm a developer living in Hawaii.  This
is my personal blog where I write about anything and everything that pops into
my head.  This is not meant to be a technical blog, but I may at times write
tech related posts.</p> <p>The views and opinions expressed in this blog are my
own.</p>
